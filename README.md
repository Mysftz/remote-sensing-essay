<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Introduction

Since its birth in the late 1800s, it was only until the late 1930s did radar detection see major attention as it was developed to search and detect flying aircraft. Since this, the last century has shown significant improvement not only in radar detection but aircraft design as well, the evolution of aircraft design mainly started out to create fast fighter aircraft and then later turned into radar avoidance. The development of advanced RADAR was engineered before aircraft were able to be developed to avoid them, this mainly in the military was important and millions of dollars went into aircraft evolution with the prime goal of avoid such advanced RADAR technology. The Doppler shift effect played a key role in the development of RADAR systems in which the change in the waves frequency when in contact with an aircraft allowed said aircraft to be detected and its speed and direction to be analysed. The evolution of such aircraft saw a complete remodel of the structure of the aircraft, the materials used and other physical abilities that either impede RADAR detection or subdue the radio waves by either absorbing, refracting or reducing the refraction/ reflection of the radio signals. This evolution of aircraft would see the birth of stealth aircraft and a new type of aircraft warfare to begin and the development of other technology such as autonomous aircraft and navigation.

In the last century RADAR and aircraft design and technology have both evolved rapidly and reached their physical limitations with current technology. From a simple direct radio wave pulse to an array of highly sensitive radio and electromagnetic waves and the development of LIDAR (Light Imaging Detection and Ranging), RADAR has pushed aircraft to evolve alongside it. Importantly aircraft avoidance (Stealth Technology) was designed and realistically used for militaristic purposes but helped explore, research and discover new materials and understand radio and electromagnetic waves. Though aircraft can be made to be nearly invisible against old and modern RADAR detection methods then aircraft will always be able to be detected even at the smallest level, its also delicate, weak and slow all of which are factors that skirt the laws of flight finely, thus making the materials rare and the cost of the aircraft high. In conclusion a better question to ask would be why do aircraft need to avoid detection if RADAR avoidance is focus in the military sector.
